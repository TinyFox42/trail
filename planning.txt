Ok, so the first thing we need to make is the player, which is a collection of settlers and resources.
---Settlers---
Oh no, this is turning into me making an Oregon Trail d20 system...
So, the major components of a settler are:
	-Biography, stuff that doesn't really factor into the game mechanics, at least not that much. Age and sex fall into this, along with actual biographical details like name, gender, sexual orientation, the list goes on. If anything will affect actual mechanics, it will be age (which will have a table of stat changes of it), and sex (which if anything swaps a tiny bonus between strength and dexterity, along with some obvious things like only a biological female being able to get pregnant).
	-Physical traits, a description of your physical build:
		-Strength, phyiscal strength
		-Dexterity, fine motor control, reaction time, and speed
		-Constitution, physical heartiness and disease resistance
	-Mental traits, which I may or may not include:
		-Intelligence, a representation of base book smarts. I don't like this one, it should just be handled by skills. Maybe something that represents logical reasoning or memory or something
		-Wisdom, which I want to call Perception, how well you notice things
		-Charisma, your people skills. Also could be handled by the skills system
	-Skills, a mix of knowledge and intuition. I have no idea what the full list will be at the current moment. You can take multiple levels in a skill, and can learn skills. Current ideas include:
		-Medicine, how well you can treat diseases and injuries. May actually be a group of skills
		-Foraging, how well you can find and collect wild plants. May have another skill paired with it, Herbalism, which is how well you can identify a plant (so Foraging is searching and collection, Herbalism is identification)
		-Swimming
		-Hunting, which is probably another skill category, as you can be skilled in multiple methods of hunting for food, though those things could fall under some combat mechanics, where you make a Hunting check to find the animal, and then you enter Combat to actually bring it down.
		-Languages known
		-Leadership, how well you can keep the group together. I guess this implies a morale mechanic as well...
		-A bunch more, as this will be the major mechaic of the game
	-Current condition, which includes any diseases, morale, relations with other Settlers, and a bunch of other stuff. 
---General talking---
I want this to be easy to mod, pulling a lot of stuff from .csv or .txt files. Definitely want you to be able to add new skills, maybe add new traits, and I want to make it so that you can at least mod in elves (as in, add in a second "race" (species or breed) that changes up base skills and traits). Oh, and I definetly want to add a config option for having people medically or magically transition, maybe also for homosexual reproduction.
---Caravan System---
So, what the actual player will be in charge of is the Caravan as a whole, which is a collection of Settlers and resources. I have already said that. Anyway, the Caravan is made up of wagons (or other vehicles, probably want to add in modding support for that), which allow the Caravan to move the resources, and I have to do research to find out if people actually rode in the wagons or walked next to them.
I don't know why I keep on saying resources, when what I really mean is supplies. Food, water, bullets, stuff to start you new life, bullets, I can't think of any other broad categories right now, bullets, etc., and bullets.

... I think I'm ready to start coding the base system of this game.
Nope, I need more planning about how I'm going to do this.
---Content Files---
So, this will basically be a complicated choose-your-own adventure game, so a major file will be the book. I'll probably split it up into scenes, to keep the individual file sizes down. But yeah, I guess what I'm really coding is an interpereter for my own coding language, because I want this to be easy to modify (hardcode as little as possible).
But really there will be like 3 major files/file types:
	-The script, which may be really difficult. Has commands written into it that call up other script files and roll dice and put in your name and pronouns and such. Oh, and commands to ask for player input, that's important, isn't it. The module that the GM is following
	-The skills, which is a list of all the skill names, costs, and such. Used to initialize the Settler system, so that we know what variables to create. If a skill is called for in the Script that doesn't exist in the Skills, it will throw an error (probably should write up something that checks the Script and points out any lines with errors, maybe compress or compile the Script as well)
	-The Cast, which will be 2 files, one which will be the Settlers (created by the player, probably should write a tool that creates a Cast file for the player), and another which will be all the NPCs and such (think of this as the book of Statblocks, the MM)
